About the My NustaComment Project

Purpose
The purpose of the My #NustaComment app is to discover Instagram image and comment on the same. We do this by encouraging our community, and the public at large, to add the #ShutterSpotClick hashtag to their photos. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our University archives, with proper attribution to the original account that created the image. It also allows us to share this media through the My @aditya_dexterx page.

Achiving the My #ShutterSpotClick Story
Social media plays a crucial role in documenting the unique cultural history of our institution. For that reason we are working to include relevant social media items in our University archives. All approved images tagged #ShutterSpotClick will be included in searches . Images selected for inclusion in the archives will be harvested by us.

Removal of Images
Users may contact me or remove hashtag to remove their images from this search.  Requesting that the photo be removed will remove it from both the My usage site as well as the searches. If you have posted a photo that you would like removed simply send an DM to @aditya_dexterx with your Instagram username and we will guide you.

Terms of Use
The public is encouraged to contribute to My #ShutterSpotClick often by tagging multiple Instagram photos with the hashtag #ShutterSpotClick.
Popular images are determined by a combination of a photograph’s battle wins and the "likes" on the photograph. "Likes" on Instagram do not count towards the popularity score. "Likes" have to be submitted on the My #ShutterSpotClick app to affect the popularity ranking.
The photograph must obey all laws, including applicable copyright and privacy laws.
